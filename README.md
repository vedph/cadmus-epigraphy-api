## History

- 2023-04-12: updated packages.

### 1.0.1

- 2023-03-09: updated packages.
- 2023-02-11: updated thesauri.

### 1.0.0

- 2023-02-03: migrated to new components factory. This is a breaking change for backend components, please see [this page](https://myrmex.github.io/overview/cadmus/dev/history/#2023-02-01---backend-infrastructure-upgrade). Anyway, in the end you just have to update your libraries and a single namespace reference. Benefits include:
  - more streamlined component instantiation.
  - more functionality in components factory, including DI.
  - dropped third party dependencies.
  - adopted standard MS technologies for DI.
